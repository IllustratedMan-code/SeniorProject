I&rsquo;m very interested in bioinformatics, the marriage
of computers and biology. One of the reasons
that I have so much interest in this field is
because of an old flash game called Cellcraft.
This game taught me the same cellular
anatomy as my high school biology class,
but I didn&rsquo;t even realize I was learning. I
would play that game for hours, carefully
managing resources Like ATP and ribosomes
to battle bacteria and viruses. For my
Senior project, I&rsquo;m hoping to replicate my experience
with Cellcraft by creating an educational
video game that aims to teach players about
genetics while also being fun enough to stand
on its own.

One of my favorite parts of my college
experience has been applying my computational
skills to classes not commonly associated with
computer science. In my human genetics
class<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="#fn.1" role="doc-backlink">1</a></sup>, I wrote a program to translate
codons into respective amino acids, simplifying
a few homework assignments. In my ecology
class<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="#fn.2" role="doc-backlink">2</a></sup>, I did all the required analysis with
the R programming language instead of Excel,
which made my plots and figures stand out. My
favorite computer science class has to be Will Hawkins III&rsquo;s Programming
Languages class<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="#fn.3" role="doc-backlink">3</a></sup>. It gave me a glimpse into the truly expansive world of
programming Languages and showed me the wonder of learning new
ones. Interestingly enough, Learning more about programming languages made me think of the
similarities between biological processes and
formal Language concepts. This connection was
deepened by Formal Languages and Automata<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="#fn.4" role="doc-backlink">4</a></sup>.
DFA&rsquo;s bear a striking resemblance to the
depictions of biological processes like the
Citric acid cycle. I love making
connections between the fields of biology and computer science
whenever I can. Throughout my classroom adventures, I developed team-work skills
in group projects and aquired the ability to learn new concepts quickly. Emacs
has been my constant companion, helping me take notes and write programs. I
think my organizational skills have been my biggest strength, helping me both in
classes and on Co-op.

My Co-op experience has consisted entirely
of bioinformatics research both here at
UC and at Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s. My first Co-op
was in the Benoit laboratory here at UC. I
learned a lot about ticks, designing Lab
equipment to better observe their behavior I performed
some RNA-seq analysis, beginning my long journey
familiarizing myself with bioinformatics tools. I
first learned the R programming language
on this Coop. In my time here, I picked up lots of diverse
skills that made me sort of a jack of all trades. I used CAD software, infra-red
cameras, 3D printers, compute clusters, and a variety of programming languages.
Next, I joined the Weirauch
Laboratory at Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s and spent
time designing, testing, and using analysis
pipelines. Learning how to create pipelines is a hugely valuable skill, one that
I wished I had acquired earlier. I spent the most time working with
ATAC-seg data, which relates to chromatin
accessibility. One of the hardest parts of this Co-op was learning both the
required computational skills but also the biological knowledge necessary to
actually know what I was doing. Part of the reason I want to make
this video game is to make the knowledge I have
gained more accessible.

My goal is to make this game easily insert-able
into school curriculums, but easy enough to
learn that those of almost any education level
can have fun playing. To this end, I think the
best setup consists of a guided set of levels
that teach the game&rsquo;s mechanics as well as key genetics
concepts. In addition, I&rsquo;m hoping to include an
&ldquo;endless&rdquo; mode that allows players to
practice the concepts they have learned. The
&rsquo;game&rsquo;s interface should be point and click only
to be as accessible as possible. The actual
mechanics of the game will be determined by the
content, so solidifying the order in which genetics
concepts are to be covered is a top priority in the early phases of development.
To ensure that the game can achieve its
objective, I&rsquo;m planning on reaching out to local
Science teachers / professors so that they and their
students can play test the game. That way,
my team and I can get detailed feedback to
make the game better. I&rsquo;m also planning on creating
a detailed week by week plan so that my team
and I can stay on track. If we can create
a game that forms an easily expandable base for
future content that stands alone as an educational
resource, I will be happy.
