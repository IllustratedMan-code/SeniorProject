## Project Description

### Project Topic

Educational video game for genetics

### Project Abstract

This project is an educational video game about genetics. Genetics is a broad topic, so it had to be constrained to fit a smaller set of concepts. To that end, this project is aimed at high school aged children that are taking a biology class. ​

A high school biology class covers genetics concepts that include traits, alleles, genes, inheritance, and evolution. To ensure that this project can be used by the vast majority of its target audience, accessibility is a major constraint. ​

To that end, this project will include international language features, a mouse-focused user interface, and will take into account color-blind users.

## User Stories and Design Diagrams

### User Stories 

-   As a high school biology teacher, I want an education game to teach genetics, as I am always looking for ways to keep my students engaged.
-   As a biology student, I want a game to help me study genetics, because I have a hard time focusing on traditional educational materials.
-   As a gamer, I want a unique game to play, as I am always searching for new game concepts.
-   As a high school biology teacher, I want a game that tracks student progress, as I want to evaluate student learning and effort.
