## Project Sought

There isn't a specific project that I am seeking. However, a project that leverages my experience in some way may be suitable. I am also interested in doing something I have yet to do much of to learn more from it. Projects I have yet to gain experience with could include embedded/hardware work or any project outside the web application space.
