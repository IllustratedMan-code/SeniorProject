# Connor McKinney Capstone Assessment
The senior design project that I have decided to pursue combines several of my longtime
personal interests. The project I will be participating in has a final goal of creating a fun,
educational, and interactive game to teach students of all ages some of the foundations of
biology. This idea speaks to me personally as I have always had a love of educational games,
having played several notable ones throughout my childhood that only increased my passion for
knowledge in the game’s targeted subject. At the same time, I feel that the core concepts of
biology are not adequately represented in educational games that are currently available. I also
have a desire to learn more about biology personally, as it is one subject that I haven’t studied
extensively in my education so far. My hope is that my team will be able to create a game that I
would have happily played and enjoyed during my childhood.

My classes in the Computer Science program here at UC will hopefully have prepared me
quite adequately for the task that my team and I are about to undertake. I think that the classes I
have taken regarding the software development lifecycle and project management (EECE
3093C) will allow me and my team to avoid any potential problems with a poorly structured
project. Using the things we have learned in these classes, we plan to thoroughly document all
stages of this project, specifically focusing on the early groundwork that must be laid. I also
foresee that the classes I have taken relating to web/digital design (IT 1050) will also come in
handy for creating the website that will likely be made alongside our final project. I also believe
that the English classes I have taken, Technical and Scientific Writing specifically (ENGL 4092),
will have me properly prepared for any formal documentation or presentations that will need to
be created for the project. With all of these combined, I feel confident that I have been
adequately prepared for my senior design project by my continuing education at UC.

I also believe that my various co-op experiences while attending UC have given me some
important skills that I will be able to utilize during this project. To name one, I learned a lot about
3D modeling and the tools and software that are used while on co-op with Honeywell
Intelligrated as a Software Engineering Intern. This knowledge will likely turn out to be very
useful with how prevalent 3D modeling is in game development. Another skill I learned on co-op
that will likely be useful is full stack development, which I got the chance to learn and practice
as a Software Engineering Intern while on co-op with both Marathon Petroleum and Siemens.
While the backend knowledge will likely still be useful, I think the front-end experience I
accrued while working in these positions will give me a leg up on the visual portions of this
project. In the realm of soft skills, I think that time management, which I got the chance to
practice and perfect during my hybrid and remote internships, will allow me to be successful
with the occasionally limited time that I will have to work on this project throughout the rest of
my academic year.

What makes me most excited about this project is the great team that we have put
together, as I can’t wait to proudly present this project with them in a few short months. I know
each of my three teammates personally and I am confident that we will be able to put together a
quality project with such a passionate and hard-working team. Another thing that excites me is
the educational aspect of the game that we are creating. One of my main goals throughout my
entire life regarding my career was to somehow make the world a better place for future
generations, regardless of how little an impact I make. I think that if my team can create a fun
game that kids will want to play, they will learn whether they realize it or not and hopefully
develop a passion for such an important subject as Biology. An impact like this can only be
positive and I think genuinely will go towards making the future a little bit brighter.

So far, our preliminary approach has been to constantly brainstorm ideas relating to this
concept of a biology-focused educational game. Individually, we have come up with ideas and
written them down, eventually meeting and discussing our ideas and figuring out what we think
might work as a main gameplay loop and overall design. Our expected result is to deliver a
quality, educational, and fun game that people of all ages can use to learn some of the core
concepts of biology in an enjoyable way, outside of the classroom. To ensure that we accomplish
these goals, I plan to consistently self-evaluate my contributions to the project by routinely
asking myself if I have truly given as much time as I can to this project in a given week. My
colleagues are as passionate about this as I am and the last thing I want is to disappoint them
because I didn’t budget my time well enough to contribute to the project for a week. While I
don’t know if we will ever truly be done, as we have plans to continue adding to this game even
after the Senior Design aspect of the project ends, I am confident that we will know we have
done a good job when we allow people in our target demographic to try out what we have
created and see their positive reactions.
