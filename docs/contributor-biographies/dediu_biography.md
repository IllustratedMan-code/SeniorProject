## Work Experience

### Siemens DISW

May 2023 to Aug 2023

Worked on client-side JS web app code. App uses a model-view-viewmodel declarative framework. My semester involved designing a POC which cut loading times for a specific action by a factor of 10. I gained experience with web development and JS frameworks.

### Tenet3 Cybernetics

My first rotation consisted of successfully compiling tens of open-source projects written in C using the unconventional LLVM compiler. I gained experience using Linux and conmmand line as well as processing massive amounts of data into organized formats by writing python scripts.

For my second rotation, I successfuly deployed a given application architecture in AWS using their Cloud Development Kit. I developed several Lambda functions and deployed a subnet and database. On top of AWS and cloud development, I gained some experience with some networking and databases.

## Project Sought

I am open to any projects. I am really interested in the ever evolving field of AI, and I would be interested in leveraging AI and ML tools in a project. I am also interested in developing an application for a real world use/issue.

I am open to using any technologies/languages. I have a good ability to pick up new technologies/languages.
