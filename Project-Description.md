## Project Topic

An educational video game for genetics. More information is to come soon.

## Project Abstract

This project is an educational video game about genetics. Genetics is a broad topic, so it had to be constrained to fit a smaller set of concepts. To that end, this project is aimed at high school aged children that are taking a biology class. ​

A high school biology class covers genetics concepts that include traits, alleles, genes, inheritance, and evolution. To ensure that this project can be used by the vast majority of its target audience, accessibility is a major constraint. ​

To that end, this project will include international language features, a mouse-focused user interface, and will take into account color-blind users.
